# ToDoListFrontend 

Coding assignment - online to-do list

Sample application requires an online TODO List. This project is the frontend part of the project. Developed using React framework with JavaScript.

My expertice is on backend development. The frontend is implemented to allow end users to test backend easier. This frontend requires the backend to be up and running on localhost port: 8080.


## Installation and Setup

- Download / Clone the repository
- Install NPM packages: `npm install`
- To run: `npm start`


## Improvements

- Even though the code runs without a problem, a better component seperation is mandatory.
- Update and Delete buttons may be hidden in normal use and would be revealed by swipe. 
- Adding a new item and updating description in a current item may use a single TextField.
